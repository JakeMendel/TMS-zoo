# Toy Neural Network Zoo: Training Dynamics and Phase Transitions

Welcome to the Toy Neural Network Zoo! This repository contains a collection of small scale, 'toy', neural network models designed to facilitate in-depth study of training dynamics and phase transitions, with a focus on developmental interpretability. This is a great resource for researchers, data scientists, or anyone interested in the granular workings of neural networks.

## Introduction
In this repository, we present a suite of models that allow you to get hands-on experience with neural network training dynamics. In particular, these models enable us to investigate the role of phase transitions in the learning process, a relatively understudied aspect of deep learning.

## Installation
Before getting started, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your machine:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- PyTorch 1.5 or higher
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
s
Clone this repository to your local machine using:
```
git clone https://github.com/JakeMendel/TMS-zoo.git
```
Navigate to the downloaded folder and install the required packages:

```
cd TMS-zoo
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Available Models

We have various toy models available, including but not limited to:

- Toy models of superposition


## Usage

All models are self-contained in their respective folders (eventually), each with its own README detailing specific usage instructions. In general, you can run each model as follows:

```
python model_name/main.py
```

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to this repository! If you have a toy model you'd like to add, or an improvement to an existing model, please feel free to make a pull request. Make sure to provide a detailed explanation of your changes or additions.
